# STEMNetX Coding/Data Science/Scientific Computation Workshop

Welcome to the repository of materials for 2025 STEMNetX Coding Bootcamp!

All of the Jupyter notebooks and datafiles that we'll be using for the camp can be found here.  It is best that you wait until the beginning of each day's sesstion to download the files, and Mike *might* be tweaking them up until the last second *:^)*

The schedule for the in-person camp is:
 - Day 1, 9:30-12:30: Welcome, installing `python`, background, basic syntax, control structures
 - Day 2, 9:30-12:30: Types, lists, dictionaries, file I/O, data visualization
 - Day 3, 9:30-12:30: Monte Carlo techniques, fitting
 - Day 4, 9:30-12:30: Text manipulation, data reduction with `Pandas`, project assignments
 - Day 5, 9:30-12:30: Final presentations, wrap session
 
There will typically be two notebook files for each of days 1-4.
